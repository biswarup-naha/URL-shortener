URL shortener

Design a URL shortener that takes in a valid URL &
returns a shortened URL, redirecting the user to the 
previously provided URL.

Also, keep trak of total visits/clicks on the URL.

Routes:
1. POST/URL - generates a new short URL and returns the 
shortened URL in the format example.com/random-id
2. GET/:id - redirects the user to the original URL.
3. GET/URL/analytics/:id - returns the click for the provided
short id.
